# Game Profile Argument {#game-profile}

The argument is a target selector, such as `EntityArgument` and returns `GameProfile`. Stellar imports the Mojang authlib library for you, which includes `GameProfile`. Only use this argument if you already know what `GameProfile` is, as you obviously shouldn't be using this argument if you don't.
